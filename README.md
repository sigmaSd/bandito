A frontend for [eltrafico](https://github.com/sigmaSd/Eltrafico)

An AppImage is automatically built with each commit via GitHub CI.
The build script is located at `scripts/appImage.ts`

### Demo

### Usage

Basic command structure:
```
MONITOR=${Monitor} TC=${pathToEltraficoTc} deno run -A --unstable main.ts ${NetInterface}
```

Example usage:
```
MONITOR=bandwhich TC=/dev/rust/cargo_target_dir/debug/tc deno run -A --unstable main.ts wlan0
```

Note: The `MONITOR` variable is optional. Without it, Bandito functions but won't display live process network usage.

## Notes and Runtime Dependencies

Current Testing Environment:
- Tested on Fedora 40

Functionality:
- Utilizes 'tc' for network traffic shaping

Caution: As with any network-altering software, bugs may occur. In case of issues, a system reboot will reset all values.

**Runtime Dependencies:**

These dependencies should be integrated into the AppImage in future updates. For now, they are required:

- libwebgtkkit-4.0
- (Additional dependencies may be required)
